/**
 * The vocabulary every device serializes with.
 *
 * Snapshots travel as JSON over the debug protocol, so a device's state has to
 * be JSON-ready — no typed arrays, no Maps, no class instances. Byte arrays
 * become base64: four characters per three bytes, against roughly three
 * characters per byte for `[0,0,0,…]`, which turns 32 KB of RAM into 44 KB
 * encoded instead of over 100 KB.
 *
 * Every read validates. A snapshot is untrusted input — a truncated file, a
 * hand-edited field, a format written by a build this one has never seen — and a
 * device that quietly accepted `undefined` for a register would leave the
 * machine in a state no real board can be in, which is far harder to diagnose
 * than a refusal.
 *
 * Buffer rather than atob/btoa because it exists in every context this code
 * runs in: plain Node in the headless host, and the renderer, which already
 * polyfills it (Video's framebuffer is a Buffer).
