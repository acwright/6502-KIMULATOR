/**
 * Whatever is on the far end of the serial card's cable.
 *
 * The card and its jumpers decide which of the chip's pins follow the cable
 * (see `IO/SerialCard.ts`); a peer decides what is on the cable. It owns two
 * things: the RTS the machine gives it, and the CTS, DCD and DSR it asserts.
 *
 * There are two kinds.
 *
 * - **A console or a pipe** (`SerialConsole` headless; the machine's own queue
 *   in `ACIA.tick` everywhere). It honours RTS or ignores it, which is the
 *   machine's `flowControl`, and its lines are asserted unless something says
 *   otherwise — a terminal with its port open asserts them.
 * - **A real host serial port**, in the app. The machine's RTS drives the
 *   port's real RTS line, and the port's real CTS, DCD and DSR are read back
 *   into the chip. The host's own `rtscts` stays off, so that it does not
 *   fight the machine for the line.
 *
 * A peer's lines only reach the chip where the card wires a pin to the cable.
 * With every jumper at ground, as by default, none of them do, and a peer that
 * drops CTS changes nothing.

 *
 * The machine is passed on each call rather than held, because a host can
 * replace its machine (fitting or pulling a card, or wiring another accessory)
 * under a link that outlives it. A new machine starts from nothing known, so both directions are
 * sent afresh.
