/**
 * Conformance with the WDC W65C02S, which is the part the real hardware uses.
 *
 * The distinction from the Rockwell R65C02 matters in two places. WDC adds WAI
 * ($CB) and STP ($DB) on top of the Rockwell bit instructions. And where the
 * Rockwell part leaves the unused opcode space loosely defined, WDC specifies a
 * width and a cycle count for every one — several are two or three bytes, not
 * one-byte NOPs.
 *
 * Width is the part worth testing. An unused opcode that consumes the wrong
 * number of operand bytes leaves the PC in the wrong place, so every
 * instruction after it decodes differently from real silicon — which is exactly
 * the situation you are in when debugging a program that has run off into data.
