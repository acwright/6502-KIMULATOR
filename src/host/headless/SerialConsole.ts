 * Bridges a byte stream to the emulated 6551 ACIA, so the host's stdio becomes
 * the machine's terminal.
 *
 * This works with no firmware changes because the KC Monitor already does the
 * hard part: `KernalInit` probes the slots, finds the Serial Card and sets
 * `HW_SC` in `HW_PRESENT`, and from then on the monitor echoes its prompt and
 * reads its commands over the ACIA. Boot a machine with io5 fitted and a TTY on
 * the other end is the serial monitor described in `KC Monitor.asm` — which is
 * exactly the laptop-plugged-into-the-board experience the real thing needs.
 *
 * With the card pulled there is no serial path at all and nothing constructs
 * one: that machine is driven from the pad, and read off the LCD.

   * drains a byte per CPU tick, but the firmware's input buffer is not.
   * Dumping a pasted program in one go would overrun that buffer and silently
   * lose input — which is the same reason the Paste box in the window paces its
   * bytes.
   *
   * With the machine's `flowControl` on (the default) this also holds the
   * queue while the machine has RTS raised, as a terminal doing RTS/CTS flow
   * control would — including from reset until the firmware programs the ACIA.
   * With it off RTS is ignored.
