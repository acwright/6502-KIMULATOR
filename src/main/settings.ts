   * model and jumpers came. `flowControl` carries over as it is — it was
   * always the far end honouring RTS, which is what it still says.
   * `serialConfig.rtscts` is dropped: the port opens without the OS's RTS/CTS
   * whatever it says, and a field that is written back but never read would
   * read as a choice still in force. The card takes `DEFAULT_SERIAL_CARD` (see
   * `load`), the Serial Card with `CTS EN` at ground, which is the machine
   * every earlier version ran. `serialCardFitted` is untouched. So a version 2
   * file behaves exactly as it did.
