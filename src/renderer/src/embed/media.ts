 * The inline half is free — the bytes came out of the URL. The fetched half is
 * the one with conditions on it, and both of them are the host page's to satisfy,
 * not ours:
 *
 * - **CORS.** A cross-origin `rom=` / `bin=` needs
 *   `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` from whatever serves it. Nothing the embed can
 *   do makes up for its absence.
 * - **CSP.** `embed.html` widens `connect-src` to `'self' https:` for exactly
 *   this fetch; a plain `http:` URL is still refused, and correctly so.
 *
 * When either one fails the embed says so and boots anyway — a docs page with a
 * broken program link should still show a working KC Monitor.
