 * What `6502-kim run` hands the desktop app when it launches it.
 *
 * The CLI cannot poke a machine that lives in another process's renderer, so
 * a windowed run passes its media and settings forward instead: the CLI writes
 * a BootConfig to a temp file, puts `--boot-config=<path>` on the app's command
 * line, and main turns it into a BootPayload the renderer applies during its
 * normal boot sequence.
 *
 * Paths, not bytes, cross that boundary — a command line has no room for a ROM
 * image, and main is the process with filesystem access anyway. The CLI still
 * checks every file is readable before spawning, so a typo is a message in the
 * terminal rather than a window that opens missing its program.
